## Results:

### Peak Location and number of rides
The dashboard shows two symbol maps: one with the top starting locations (where the bikes are rented) and the other with the top final location (where the bikes are returned). On both maps the sizes of the dots go from small to big representing the less popular location to most popular ones. Also, the color gradient goes from less popular to most popular locations. Both, the size and the color of the dots help identify at a glance which are the most popular locations.

### Peak time usage
The following dashboard shows two bar graphs comparing the times in hours vs the number of rides (or the number of bikes rented/returned). The blue graph represents the peak hours when the bikes are rented per day. The orange graph represents the peak hours where the bikes are returned.

### Trip Duration
The following dashboard presents the duration in minutes per trip. In both graphs the peak hours of usage are from 4 to 6. The difference in these two graphs is that the second is divided by gender, showing that the most users are male.

### Trip duration Weekday per hour
The following image shows two heat maps representing the bike trips by weekday per each hour of the day. The first map just represents the previously said, while the second is divided by gender. In both the darker colors are shown between 7am to 9am and 5pm to 7pm on weekdays.

### Who is using the bikes?
The following two dashboards are dedicated to study the users. 

The first dashboard is to show the usage by gender and age group. The following graphs are:
-	Pie chart: representing the differences between gender users. Male users are predominant.
-	Heat-map: representing the usage per week but also per user type, customer is a one time user and subscriber is the customer who pays in advance to use this service. The colors in the “customer” block do not vary as much as in the “subscriber” block. Whichever is the usage by “customer” is very steady within the month studied.
-	Stacked bar chart: showing the percentage of bike rides per age group and per gender.
-	Horizontal bar chart: representing the number of rides per customer type and at the same time the percentage of users by gender.

Pie chart: showing the difference in user type.
Horizontal bar chart: representing the number of rides versus the type of consumer.
Vertical bar chart: comparison between the number of rides and age group per consumer and subscribers.

## Summary:

Base on the analysis perform, the target market for the bike sharing business are young adult subscriber males. It could be deduced that most of these users are utilizing the service to commute to and from work. This could help to a further analysis on where to locate the bikes in Des Moines. Maybe the target for this business is not the tourist but the working population of the city. 

Also, another observation from this analysis is that the times for bike's maintenance should be schedule for 2am to 4am.

Additional visualizations (if the data is provided) could be:
1.	Month usage study, the more data the more accurate the analysis could be.
2.	Monthly cost on maintenance.
3.	Monthly revenue of subscribers vs one-time costumers.
